# hexGame in C++
## by Carlos Granados

A very first implementation of the game of hex in C++, for 2 players.

The makefile compile directly the code, using the intel compilers...

The code is based on a basic `graph class` to implement the hex board. The `player class` is responsible to check the moves of each player and to verify after each move if a player won the match.
